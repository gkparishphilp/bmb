		%h4 Will the eBooks work on my eReader?
		%p
			After purchase, we send you a link to download in files for Kindle, Nook, iPad, and any reader that takes the ePub format. We also include links on how to get your new eBook onto Kindle, Nook and iPad. If you have another reader that takes ePub, just consult the manufactuer's site to see how to add the file.
	
		%h4 Glad to hear the files will work, but how do I get them onto my eReader?
		%p
			Every eReader is a bit different, so it' shard to give a one-size-fits-all answer to this question.  We recommend consulting your specific eReader's documentation.  Here are some resources for the most common readers:
			%li.indent
				Kindle owners may want to start
				= link_to 'here.', "http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200505520&#email"
			%li.indent
				Nook owners should definitely 
				= link_to 'check this out', "http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/container/standard_bothnavs.asp?PID=35677#"
				(specifically, the video for #6).
			%li.indent
				And iPad folks should 
				= link_to 'read this.', "http://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-news/2010/04/using-itunes-to-add-epub-files-to-ibooks.html"
		
		%h4 Can I order more than one thing? Where's my shopping cart?
		%p
			Absolutely! You can order however many different items you like, but the "continue shopping" option is still pending.  Instead, if you don't see the combo you want, you're just going to have to place multiple orders for now.  We're sorry about that, and now that the the eBooks and audiobooks are launched, we'll work on shining up the rest.

		%h4 I own a hardcover copy of THE STARTER, and will be receiving the eBook for free.  Instead, will you discount the cost of THE STARTER from another item (like the flash drive)?  
		%p
			No.  All the "Make it Right" copies of THE STARTER eBook will be sent as stand alone items, and no adjustments or special deals on other items will be made to accommodate.
		
		%h4 Can I also get a free copy of THE ROOKIE eBook?  Can I trade my free eBook for a free audiobook?
		%p
			Nope.  The "Make it Right" offer only applies only to the eBook of THE STARTER.  No substitutions will be made.  The eBooks are in .mobi or .epub formats and will work on most eReaders.  
		%h4 Will Scott personalize my hardcover?
		%p
			Alas, the time for personalization is long gone.  The only way to obtain personalized copies of the hardcover is to call Borderlands Books, just as you would for any other Sigler novel.
		%h4 Will you ship the hardcover to my country/APO/FPO/backwater town?
		%p
			Yes.
		%h4 What if THE STARTER or THE ROOKIE sells out before I can buy a copy?
		%p
			Life is cold, brutish, short and hella unfair. Better get on that while you can.
