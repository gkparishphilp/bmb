Hi <%= @user.name  %>,

It seems you've asked to reset your password.

To do so, just click on the link below or copy and paste the URL into your browser:
<%= reset_url( :token => @user.remember_token ) %>

You can then change your password to anything you'd like.  This URL will be valid for 24 hours.

Thanks!
