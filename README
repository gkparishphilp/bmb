Site Article no longer static page, now article.

Punchlist

- What happened to PayPal?
- What about coupon redemption ajax?
- Only skus can be ordered, so need SKU for subscriptions with subscription as the only item (like merch)

- Follow logic?? How does unsubscribe work?

GK
----

- Recommends/Backer controller
- Header menus (graphical)
- Reporting
- Scope everything on status
- Double-check all permissions

Tay
----
- Follow logic - blog comments example
- Admin subscriptions - Need order page
- Add raw_stat call to @article and @post show actions, ie: @post.raw_stats.create :name =>'view', :ip => request.ip


DONE
-----
- OpenID logins - Bail on open id and create a registration email capture screen for the current site
- Admin email
- Delayed job installed...  Just call from code like before
- Raw stats model - cleaned up from old version.  Just create a raw stat and it will automatically rate_limit and update the real stat through delayed_job

- User profile page
	- low priority
- Library -- let's punt for now -- just use email

- Books, assets, sku 
	- got STI assets, need to wire in interface
	- done
- Admin Ecom/Store (create bundles, merch, etc.) - could use polish, but should work for launch/Sigler
