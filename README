Site Article no longer static page, now article.

All Assets have attached documents (where the actual file lives)
Assets are of type: etext, audio, or pdf
Assets can be put into SKUs (as can merch)
SKUS are of type ebook, audio_book, merch, or custom

- Jquery UI styles -- buttons/datepicker, etc


Punchlist
 
- What about coupon redemption ajax?
- Check model relationships between sku, sku_item, asset, merch, subscriptions, etext, etc.
- Homepage - bring in old blog articles
- Register - help copy
- Author signup - make it not suck, more than a link
- Author signup - help copy
- Patch theme picker so it doesn't duplicate theme items when you pick a default theme.
- Add a book - edit title = Pick Cover Art
- Add an asset - price should be entered with dollars and cents, and converted to cents when saved
- Sitewide Blog/Podcast -- check data import, no admin console for now


GK
----
- Pop_flash for email that has been previously created in user table
- Header menus (graphical)
	- William
- Reporting
	- uhhhhh probably punt
- Scope everything on status
- Double-check all permissions

Tay
----
- Migrate files and avatars
- Don't save billing and shipping address for anonymous purchases
- Author no longer has domain field.  Site object is created, move vhost creation to site model
- Fulfillment emails for author and for users
	- Need link to download etexts, what about anonymous users downloading etexts?
- Fix raw stats that are being commented out
	- Add raw_stat call to @article and @post show actions, ie: @post.raw_stats.create :name =>'view', :ip => request.ip
- Admin subscriptions - Need order page
- Check coupon code functionality for Paypal express
- Don't allow subscriptions to be ordered with Paypal express

PUNT for Sigler launch
----------------------
- Follow logic - blog comments example
    - Got observer and email to work.  Need unsubscribe logic now.
- Recommends/Backer controller
	- need to re-think/workaround delayed job
- Make error messages on Paypal Express purchase nicer when email isn't present
- Library -- let's punt for now -- just use email
- Thinking Sphinx

DONE
-----
- OpenID logins - Bail on open id and create a registration email capture screen for the current site
- Admin email
- Delayed job installed...  Just call from code like before
- Raw stats model - cleaned up from old version.  Just create a raw stat and it will automatically rate_limit and update the real stat through delayed_job
- Change ecom to use sku instead of ordered
- User profile page
	- low priority
- Books, assets, sku 
	- got STI assets, need to wire in interface
	- done
- Admin Ecom/Store (create bundles, merch, etc.) - could use polish, but should work for launch/Sigler
- What happened to PayPal Express?
