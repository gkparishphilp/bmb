Site Article no longer static page, now article.

All Assets have attached documents (where the actual file lives)
Assets are of type: etext, audio, or pdf
Assets can be put into SKUs (as can merch)
SKUS are of type ebook, audio_book, merch, or custom


- Jquery UI styles -- buttons/datepicker, etc
- Sitewide Blog/Podcast -- check data import, no admin console for now


Punchlist

- What happened to PayPal?
    # I haven't put in Paypal Express yet.  We can punt on it, and put it in shortly afterwards.
- What about coupon redemption ajax?
- Only skus can be ordered, so need SKU for subscriptions with subscription as the only item (like merch)

- Follow logic?? How does unsubscribe work?
    # Will work on the unsubscribe logic when I get back.  I think I'll need an unsubscribe_code field on the follows table.  Or create an unsubscribe table, with an unsubscribe_code and a polymorphic entity to what is being unsubscribed.  Any other ideas on how to handle unsubscribes?  

GK
----

- Recommends/Backer controller
	- need to re-think/workaround delayed job
- Header menus (graphical)
	- William
- Reporting
	- uhhhhh probably punt
- Scope everything on status
- Double-check all permissions

Tay
----
- Follow logic - blog comments example
    - Got observer and email to work.  Need unsubscribe logic now.
- Admin subscriptions - Need order page
- Add raw_stat call to @article and @post show actions, ie: @post.raw_stats.create :name =>'view', :ip => request.ip


DONE
-----
- OpenID logins - Bail on open id and create a registration email capture screen for the current site
- Admin email
- Delayed job installed...  Just call from code like before
- Raw stats model - cleaned up from old version.  Just create a raw stat and it will automatically rate_limit and update the real stat through delayed_job

- User profile page
	- low priority
- Library -- let's punt for now -- just use email

- Books, assets, sku 
	- got STI assets, need to wire in interface
	- done
- Admin Ecom/Store (create bundles, merch, etc.) - could use polish, but should work for launch/Sigler
